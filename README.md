# How to use
Simply click the upload button, browse for your Kestrel export, select it and voilà! A graphing area should appear displaying your data.
* To cycle between parameters, use the "←" and "→" buttons.
* To graph a new dataset, simply click the upload button again and select your new data.

# Wanna demo?
No prob! Example1.csv is included in this repository as a demo. The data itself is a little funky (if I remember correctly the height parameter should be around the negative fifties) but it serves to show what _your_ Kestrel data could look like!
