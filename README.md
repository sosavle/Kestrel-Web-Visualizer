# How to use
Simply click the upload button, browse for your Kestrel export, select it and voilà! A graphing area should appear displaying your data.
* To cycle between parameters, use the "←" and "→" buttons.
* To graph a new dataset, simply click the upload button again and select your new data.

# Wanna demo?
No prob! Example1.csv is included in this repository as a demo. The data itself is a little funky (if I remember correctly the height parameter should be around the negative fifties) but it serves to show what _your_ Kestrel data could look like! Here's a sample screenshot!

# Context behind Kestrel Visualizer and Web:
These repos are half personal project, half part of my undergraduate research. As of the time of writing, I'm currently working with UM's environmental engineering laboratories to evaluate bacterial presence in coastal aerosols. It's a pretty fun research avenue because I get to go to the beach quite a bit :D. 

Anyway, as part of the research, we collect many weather parameters whenever we sample, which is the area I specialize in within the project. We purchased a Kestrel 5500 weather station in order to measure several parameters, but after the first use we realized the output was a plain .csv file, and the manufacturing company did not offer any sort of visualization software. So I decided to make my own! I first made it in MATLAB, because I was taking a class on it at the time, but eventually decided it would be more accessible as a website. 

Despite being tied to my research experience, I consider it a personal project because I mainly did it during my winter break and surprised everyone in the lab when I just brought it up the next meeting. It's really still a very simple piece of software, but I like to think it could perhaps prove useful to other Kestrel owners out there too!
